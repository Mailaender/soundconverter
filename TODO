 - dont add dupplicate files 
 - find a solution when no tags & filename generated from tags

 * encoders as plugins 
 * optional "advanced" encoder settings
 * give time estimates for progress bar
 * HIG compliant interface
 * progress dialog ?
 * autotools, l12n
 * handle exceptions even when they happen in callbacks
 * add support for GNOME encoding profiles ?

 * bug: the program's options aren't printed with --help

 -ok- dropping a list a folder does not work as expected
 -ok- handle error when overwriting a file
 -ok- bug: the dialog can only be showed once
 -ok- use a raw quality setting
 -ok- display aprox. bitrate
 -ok- choose dir, add recursively input files that need to be converted
