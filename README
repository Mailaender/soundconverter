        README for GNOME sound converter application
        ============================================
        
A simple sound converter application for the GNOME environment. It reads 
anything the GStreamer library can read, and writes WAV, FLAC, MP3, and 
Ogg Vorbis files.
        

This application is somewhat less fast than various command line tools.
Not a whole lot, however, and not enough to make me worry about
performance for the foreseeable future. If you want ultimate
performance, the command line tools are always going to be preferable.


        Supported audio formats
        -----------------------

All file formats that GStreamer can read from should now be supported
(thanks to the wonderful "decodebin" element). The output formats are
more restricted, however, since there is no "encodebin" element to
magically convert to any format we might want.

        Type                Supported?
        
        Ogg Vorbis          yes
        FLAC                yes
        Wave                yes
        MP3                 yes 
        

        Localization
        ------------
These simple steps allow the translation of soundconverter:
(you'll have to replace LANG with the appropriate 2 letters country code)
 
1. create or update pot file:
xgettext ../soundconverter.py ../soundconverter.glade -o soundconverter.pot

2. create po file for a new language:
cp soundconverter.pot LANG.po

or update a po file:
msgmerge -U LANG.po soundconverter.pot

3. edit the po file with your favorite po editor (gtranslator, kbabel, ...).

4. create and install the binary mo file:
msgfmt LANG.po -o soundconverter_LANG.mo
su -c "cp soundconverter_LANG.mo /usr/share/locale/LANG/LC_MESSAGES/soundconverter.mo"
