2006-01-16  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.py: hum?!?!? File dropping was *again* broken, maybe
	  it's my evil twin which edit the code :)
	* soundconverter.py: added a timeout when reading tags.

2006-01-15  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.glade: Reverted to old UI to make a release soon.
	* soundconverter.py: Changed the gst-lame problem at vbr-quality=9
	  handling for a cleaner one. 

2006-01-11  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Makefile: Added install-local. 
	  #1154 (Thanks RÃ©gis & Janis)
	* Added a makedirs() that use gnomevfs, so folders will really be
	  created now, even on remote filesystems.

2006-01-10  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Wow, fixed the problem when we generate filenames from tags but tags
	  are not read when preparing filenames.
	  This was a big mess, and I tried numerous solutions, but I will keep
	  the only one that is working for now: just wait tags to be read
	  before starting conversion. Sorry, this sucks...
	  Hopefully I read that GStreamer 0.10 is better with threads :)

2006-01-07  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Added the possibility to pause the conversion.

2005-12-25  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Files can only be added once in the list.

2005-12-22  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Finally got walking on gnomevfs to work. Now folder importing is really
	  usable...
	* Added a default to tags, so tag-filled destination paths will
	  be valid.

2005-12-20  Gautier Portet  <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Better type detection.
	* Temporary solved the (non?) problem when trying to convert files which
	  don't have tags filled yet.
	

2005-12-05  Gautier Portet  <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Files types are now detected at loading, expect filtering on types
	  soon.

2005-11-29 Gautier Portet  <kassoulet gmail com>

	* file list is now filled asynchronously with tags if they are
	  present.
	* list display is handled completely differently, hope its better like
	  this

2005-11-08  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* better folder dropping: now we generate a good base/filename for
	  SoundFile. But it works not so well when we want to create folders
	  based on tags, so it will need some more work.

2005-11-07  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* fixed broken folder dropping. (#5561)

2005-11-06 Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	  (thanks Noa Resare <noa@resare.com>)

2005-04-15  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* reverted quality setting to 'real-world' quantities
	  -> values stored in gconf are now the values passed
       	  to gstreamer and not meaningless enums.
       	* added a label showing an aproximate bitrate in the
          preference window

2005-03-24  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Making release version 0.7

2005-03-24  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.glade: added a logo on the about box.
	
	* soundconverter.py: fixed about dialog showing only once (we need an 
	optimal method for handling dialogs).

2005-03-23  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.py: added a dialog asking what to do when a file
	exists.  

2005-03-22  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.glade: added an Add button on toolbar, added
	separators.

2005-03-17  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.py: removed xing header generation when outputing mp3, 
	since it seems to break xmms mad decoder.
	
	* soundconverter.glade: changed the preference dialog, for a cleaner
	one.

2005-03-15  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* added the quality settings for vorbis and mp3

2005-03-14  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* soundconverter.py: changed deprecated import gnome.vfs to gnomevfs

2005-02-27  Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>

	* Added basic mp3 support

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* Making release version 0.5.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* COPYING: Added.
	
	* README: Added copyright and license information.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Make sure all the keys used for formatting
	target names exist in the dict used for input to the patterns.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.1: Wrote.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Better way to stop a TagReader pipeline
	that doesn't cause Gstreamer runtime warnings. Also, allow
	selecting multiple files in the new filechooser for adding
	files.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.glade, soundconverter.py: Removed the addchoser
	dialog from the Glade file. Added code to create it in the Python
	file instead. The reason: mysteriously the "Cancel" and "Open"
	buttons disappeared from the dialog and this was the way to get
	them back, since it seems they need to be added explicitly when
	the dialog is created. Weird.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.glade: Added a shortcut ctrl-O for adding new files.

2004-12-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Since we can deal with lots of kinds of input
	files, let's not have a filter in the file chooser.

2004-12-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Now using the "decodebin" GstElement for finding
	tags and decoding. Now we should be able to handle anything GStreamer
	can handle for input.

2004-12-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* Making release version 0.4.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Handle error printing in cli mode as well.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: Refactoring to make
	error dialogs and their use better.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: Added example filename
	shown in the preferences dialog that is updated after each change.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Don't encode the name of the selected folder,
	just subfolders that are created and the basename.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: I am no longer a klutz. Implemented the 
	creation of subfolders according to patterns.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: User may choose whether
	to create subfolders below the selected folder. Not that they are
	yet created, but I happened to commit the change already by
	mistake so now I need to write a ChangeLog entry as well. I am
	such a klutz.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: User may now choose
	whether output files are put into the same directory as the 
	corresponding input files, or into a folder the user has 
	specifically chosen.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: Made it possible again
	to choose whether "messy" characters in the target filenames are
	replaced with other characters.

2004-12-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: Simplified selection of
	basename generation: now there is only a single ComboBox selection
	instead of that plus two radio buttons. This should be clearer.

2004-12-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: The user may now
	choose how the output file is named: basename is the same as
	input file (but with suffix changed) or output name is
	constructed from meta data tags.

2004-12-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Changed the TargetNameGenerator to support
	keyword based patterns for location and basename.
	
	* soundconverterTests.py: Related changes.

2004-12-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Refactoring. Information about the input file
	(location, tags) is now kept in a separate class.

2004-12-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Added support for audio/x-wav for file chooser
	filter.
	
        * soundconverter.py, soundconverter.glade: Reworked the
        Preferences dialog. Only selection of output format and Ogg
        Vorbis quality levels work for now. The rest will follow.

2004-12-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Set name on the filter for the file chooser.

2004-12-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Make the GUI report how much time was spent
	for the conversions.
	
	* README: Add note about performance.

2004-12-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Reset the internal counters for dealing with
	progress when the job is finished, so that if we start a new job,
	the counters start from zero, not at the end of the previous job.

2004-12-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Added support for drag-and-dropping files
	from Nautilus to the file list in Sound Converter. This was based
	on a patch from Chris Jones, but I re-did to fit the style of
	my code.

2004-12-12  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: In Pipeline.work, don't do anything if the
	pipeline is stopped.
	
        * soundconverter.py: In TagReader.finish, call found_tag_hook
        unless it has been called already.
        
        * soundconverter.py: Add -q/--quiet option.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* README: Updated.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * soundconverter.py: Added support for Wave files (.wav,
        audio/x-wav) as input.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* Makefile: Use snd/* for simple tag finding in "make check".
	
	* soundconverter.py: Minor refactoring.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Changed the output pipeline to use 
	gnomevfssink for output, rather than filesink. We now do all I/O
	to the sound files via GNOME vfs.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Changed TargetNameGenerator to generate 
	uris instead of filenames.
	
	* soundconverterTests.py: Related changes.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Input is now via gnomevfssrc, instead of
	filesrc, and all filenames that refer to the input have been
	converted to use file: urls.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Made usable from command line as well.

2004-11-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * Making release version 0.2.

2004-11-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * soundconverter.py: Fixed stopping.

2004-11-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * soundconverter.py: the about dialog now shows name and version
        number.
        
        * soundconverter.glade: Added a bit of space around the label in
        the prefs dialog. This didn't make it less ugly, however.

2004-11-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * soundconverter.py: Re-added support for vorbis-quality.
        
        * Makefile: Added "clean" target.
        
        * README: Cleanups and updates.

2004-11-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * soundconverter.py: Rewrote task handling and tag reading and
        conversion stuff.
        
        * README: Added.
        
        * .cvsignore: Added.

2004-11-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

        * soundconverter.py: Ported to work with current version
        (0.7.93-1) of python-gst. The change: can't create a
        gst.Element("foo"), need to call gst.element_factory_find("foo")
        instead.
        
        * soundconverter.py: Wrote a class TargetNameGenerator to generate
        the names of output files, and modified the rest of the program
        to use it. This should eventually implement a language for
        describing the output name (user can set patterns like
        "%(artist)s-%(album)s-%(title)s.%(suffix)s").
	
	* soundconverterTests.py: Wrote tests for TargetNameGenerator.
	
	* Makefile: Added a "check" target.

2004-10-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* Making release version 0.1.

2004-10-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.glade, soundconverter.py: If an output file
	  exists, ask the user what to do.

2004-10-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* Makefile: Wrote.

2004-10-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.glade, soundconverter.py: Added a preferences
	  dialog to allow setting of the quality level of the Ogg Vorbis
	  files we create. The value is stored in GConf.

2004-10-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Got rid of the useless File class, since the
	  same data is stored in the GtkListStore as well.

2004-10-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: More refactoring. Got rid of the useless
	  (since we only have one window) SoundConverterApp class.

2004-10-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw iki fi>

	* soundconverter.py: Refactored so that the two background tasks
	  are based on a common base class that contains the common
	  functionality.
